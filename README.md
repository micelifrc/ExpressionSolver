This program will read an expression and will solve it.
In input, you need to write a single string (in one line), containing the expression you want to solve.
The expression may contain the four operations +, -, *, / (you can also write : which will be recognized as /)
You can even write ^ for powers, but this only works if the exponent is an integer, otherwise, the result may be incorrect.
